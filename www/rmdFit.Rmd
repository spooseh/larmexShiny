After importing data and selecting variables an **`lmer`** formula appears in 
**`Formula`** section. This is the model assuming a fully connected mood 
network where all autoregressive (AR) and exogenuous (EX) variables
have fixed and random components. 

### Add\Remove fixed or random components
Every term in the "formula" has a format of "FROM_TO" which corresponds to a 
temporal relation from the variable "FROM" to the variable "TO" and in turn to 
an edge in the network representation. An adjacency matrix representing a 
network is used to include terms in the formula. The presence of an edge in the
network is marked by **`1`** in the cell corresponding to the the column *FROM =>*
and the row, *=> TO*.  If you would like to delete the term, change the cell value 
to **`0`**. The upper and lower matrices represent the fixed and random effects, 
respectively. 

### Fit data
- **`Save to`**: By default the results will be saved in the "home" directory of 
the user by making a new folder named "res_[date]_[time]" in which *data* and 
*time* are taken from the moment the **`FIT`** button is pressed. One can change 
the root directory to be different than "home" by selecting a new target 
through the "Save to" button.
- **`IDs to Fit`**: Here one can select one or multiple subject IDs for fitting. The
whole data set will be fit if `All` is selected. 
- **`Center data`**: if checked, values of moods and external factors are
centered for single subjects.
- **`FIT`**: Data for individual subjects is extracted and fitted repeatedly and the 
ID of the last successfully fitted subject together with the time spent is 
printed out. The output directory is also updated by the real name of the 
created directory.

The following files are saved after a successful fit. [ID] is replaced by a 
corresponding subject ID.
- **sbj_[ID].RData**: holds a "LARMExFit" R6 object named `fit_[ID]` with with 
the following fields. Fields are accesible by `$`, e.g., `fit_someID$rawData`
  * `rawData`: subjects data
  * `sjID`:    variable name, subject ID
  * `nBeep`:   variable name, number of beeps
  * `nDay`:    variable name, number of days
  * `arList`:  list of interacting mood nodes
  * `exList`:  list of external factors acting on moods
  * `nAbb`:    long names abbreviated to this length, not if 0
  * `arAbb`:   `arList` after abbreviation
  * `exAbb`:   `exlist` after abbreviation
  * `fitID`:   subject ID
  * `frm`:     `lmer` formula to be fit
  * `fitRes`:  result of fitting 
  * `feM`:     adjacency matrix of fixed effects
  * `reM`:     adjacency matrix of random effects
  * `savePath`: path to saved results
  * `doCenter`: true if mood and external factor values are centered per subject
- **`summary_[ID].txt`**: the output of `lm4::summary()`
- **`fe_[ID].csv`**: data frame of fixed effects
- **`re_[ID].csv`**: data frame of random effects
