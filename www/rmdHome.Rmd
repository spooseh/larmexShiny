This Shiny app provides tools to fit an Exogenous Linear Autoregressive Mixed 
Effects model, LARMEx, to ecological momentary 
assessments (EMA). 

The procedure consists of two phases which are accessible through the menu items
to the left sidebar.
- **`Data`**: uploading the CSV file and choosing variables  
- **`Model`**: setting up the formula and fitting the model 

For a smooth experience it is highly recommended that you follow the menu in a 
top-down order. In case you would like to make major changes, please refresh the 
application and start over.

At the bottom of each page there is a **`Help`** section. You can go through the 
instructions by expanding it using the **`+`** sign.

*Missing left menu*:<br>
Please adjust the window size if you don't see the sidebar menu to the left
with a black background. This might happen following certain settings of 
RStudio.

### Instructions

#### Import data
- click on **`Data `** menu item on the sideber and upload a **`.CSV`**  data 
file. It is assumed that the CSV file contains column names for 
    * **`ID`**:  subject ID to extract data for a single respondent
    * **`nDay`**:  level 2 variable in a multilevel setting, e.g., number of 
    days or weeks 
    * **`nBeep`**:  level 1 variable in a multilevel setting, number of beeps 
    for EMA data
    * **`Autoregressive`**:  columns for interacting moods, e.g., M1 and M2 below
    * **`Exogenous`**:  columns for external factors, e.g., E below

#### Specify variable names
- select variable names from drop-down menus
    * if selected **`ID`**, **`nDay`**  and **`nBeep`**  don't have multilevel 
    format, conflicting columns are cleard after an error window pops up with a 
    message pointing to a potential cause.
    * you can specify if there should be an **`Abbreviation`**  on the names of 
    moods and and external factors

#### Specify the model and fit
- on the **`Model`**  page a mixed effects formula appears under **`Formula`. 
This is a full model assuming that every **`Autoregressive`**  and **`Exogenous`**  
variable has fixed- and random- effects components.
    * you can modify this formula under **`Add\Remove fixed and random components`**  
    explained below
    * the results will be saved in your **`home`**  directory in a new folder 
    named **`res_DATE_TIME`**  where DATE and TIME refer to your local values at 
    the time of pressing the **`FIT`**  button.
    * you can change the parent directory of the results folder by **`Save to`.
    * under **`IDs to Fit`**  you can choose **`All`, single or multiple IDs to 
    fit the whole data set of desired parts based of selectd IDs
    * if **`Center data`**  is checked, observations will be centered for 
    individual respondents.

#### Modify the model
- the model formula is constructed using adjacency matrices for fixed and radom 
effects

- every term represents an edge in the network from a column to a row
    * **`M2_M1`**  is the connection from **`M2`**  to **`M1`**  and corresponds 
    to the cell with column **`M2 =>`**  and row **`=> M`
- the presence (absence) of each term is shown by **`1`**  (`0`) 
- you can remove or add a term by changeing the matrix cell to zero and one respectively
- fixed and random effects are accessed by the upper and lower matrices
- to remove **`M2_M1`**  from the fixed-effects and **`E_M2`**  from the random-effects:
    * you might need to click outside the cell to have the effect
