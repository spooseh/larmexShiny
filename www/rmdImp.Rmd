Please make sure that your data has a comma separated (`CSV`) format. It is 
assumed that the following columns are present.
- **`ID`**: Subject ID with character or numerical values
- **`Day\Week`**: Number of days or weeks as integers
- **`Beep`**: Number of beeps as integers in an ascending form
- **`Autoregressive`**: Chosen from mood observations ideally mean centered for 
every subject. These are supposed to be the interacting moods in the network 
representation.
- **`Exogenous`**: External factors. These are the nodes acting on all AR nodes 
contemporaneously.

You need to choose the corresponding columns from the drop-down menus. If you 
prefer to have shorter variable names, the desired number of characters 
could be set from **`Abbreviation`** menu. If it's set to `0`, no abbreviations 
will be made.

Once all variables are chosen, the default model formula is set on the following
page, **`Model`**.
